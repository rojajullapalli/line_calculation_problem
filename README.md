# line_calculation_problem
## USECASES
#### 1. usecase 1 is As a fan of geometry, I want to model a line based on a point consisting of (x, y) co-ordinates using the Cartesian system, So that I can calculate its length - Length of a Line = sqrt( (x2 - x1) ^ 2 + (y2 - y1) ^ 2) 
#### 2. usecase 2 is As a fan of geometry, I want to check equality of two lines based on the end points, So that I know when two lines are the equal.- Using Java equals method to check equality of 2 Lengths is preferable. 
#### 3. usecase 3 is As a fan of geometry, I want to compare two lines based on the end points, So that I know one line is equal, greater or less than the other line. - Using Java compareTo method to compare 2 Lengths
